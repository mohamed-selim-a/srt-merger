# srt-merger
merges multiple subtitle files (in srt format) into one, so you can see all merged translations at the same time,
I've used it mainly to perfect my English by merging Arabic translation with English subtitles, and decided to share it.

# How to use
- drag and drop srt files to the app form
- rename the randomly named output file to the video file name, or drag and drop it to the media player if it supports this
- enjoy and learn

# issues
- the srt files are expected to be in utf-8 encoding
